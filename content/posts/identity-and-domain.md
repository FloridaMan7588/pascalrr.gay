Well, I'm migrating domains! I already have, actually. The new domain better reflects my personal identity and my evolution as a person, and I feel like Pascalrr is a better alias for myself for these reasons. I've identified with and been a part of the Queer community for a while at this point, but I have only recently been discovering my own gender identity. Over time I've tried many different things, identities, names and so on, but I think right now I'm happy with what I have. FloridaMan had a good run, for years I've used that name as my alias, but for a while now it hasn't felt right for me. Even as just an alias, it's still connected to *my identity*, and that's why I'm changing it. The `floridaman7588.me` domain will continue to be active and forward to this site, as well as `fm7588.me` and a couple others, but I will stop renewing them after they expire next. I hope that this year will be as good as the last one was, and I hope anyone reading has a pleasant day.

Much love,
